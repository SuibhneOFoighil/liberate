Ron DeSantis answers a pair of questions from moderator Adam Sexton, WMUR’s political director. DeSantis first clarifies his position on abortion and how he’d handle the issue as president before touching on the controversial slavery curriculum in Florida. DeSantis defended the education standards, saying he wants students to learn all facts of American history, including slavery but “not limited to that.”

Conversation with the Candidate is a town hall-style program recorded in advance of when it airs. It is intended to allow the candidate to convey their points of view on a wide range of topics. During the program, the moderator may challenge the candidates' assertions, but every fact may not be checked in real time. WMUR News 9 is committed to holding the candidates accountable on their claims throughout the election cycle.

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

RSVP here: https://www.facebook.com/events/923471961163492/

With the introduction of the Medicare for All Act last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders and 137 of his colleagues in Congress began the long struggle to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country not to guarantee health care to all its people. Already, 60 percent of the American people want to expand Medicare to provide health insurance to every one, but many Americans still do not know how a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system would work in the United States. 

To answer that question and more, Sen. Sanders and leading digital outlets NowThis, ATTN: and The Young Turks are partnering on a groundbreaking Medicare for All Town Hall event January 23 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. 

For the first time, leading digital outlets will come together to do what cable channels and network news will not– engage in an in-depth conversation about one of the issues that matter most to Americans, their health care. Streamed live across multiple social media channels, Sen. Sanders and leading health care experts will take questions about Medicare for All from people around the country and discuss how universal health care would change the American system.

Location: Capitol Visitors' Center Congressional Auditorium (CVC-200)

Seating is first-come, first-served. Please arrive early to ensure a seat. No posters or signs will be permitted.

""Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has become one of the Democratic Party’s leading surrogates on television, is striking out with his own multimedia special — one that will run online, with no major network behind it.

“We expect that we’ll have a larger viewing audience for this live stream than we’d have if we’d run it on, say, CNN,” Sanders said in an interview. “That’s revolutionary. You can have this discussion even if the owners of the big media companies don’t want to have it.”

On the evening of Jan. 23, Sanders will host a 90-minute “national town hall” on proposals for universal Medicare, streamed by the progressive video outlets NowThis, Attn:, and the Young Turks. The idea came to him, he said, after appearing in CNN-hosted debates and forums on health care and taxes — experiences he’d mostly enjoyed — and hit a wall.

“I talked to a very well-known TV journalist, and I said: ‘You know, I think it’d be really great to have a town hall on single payer. You can design it however you want,’ ” said Sanders. “He said, ‘Bernie, that’s a great idea. We’ll run it up the food chain.’ I never heard back.”""

When Senator Bernie Sanders announced that he was going to be doing a town hall on Fox News. You had a lot of people on the left pretty angry about it. They couldn't understand why a not a Democrat, I guess because that's what they like to say about him. Why somebody like that would go on Fox News and you're just legitimizing the network and there are so horrible and yes they are. And last night during Bernie Sanders town hall, he made a point to tell them how horrible they are. That takes a lot of courage to go on stage with host from a network and let them know that you do not respect their network because they lie to their viewers and act as a propaganda arm for the Trump administration. I don't think there's a lot of Democrats out there who would have the courage to go on stage in their faces with the Fox News hosts and tell them that, but Bernie did.
And more importantly than just pointing out the fact that the network is a giant pile of trash up. Bernie got people onto his side burning, answered questions. Bernie talked policy. Bernie did what every single democratic candidate should be doing. He talked to people, he talked to them in simple terms and they understood it and they embraced it and they liked it. When Bret Bair, one of the moderators of this town hall, Fox News host asked the audience how many would support Medicare for all rousing applause through that audience. Bret Baier was not expecting that the Fox News people were not expecting their viewers, their audience, and yes, there were plenty of Democrats in there too, but they still weren't expecting them to start cheering for Medicare for all later on in the debate or town hall shoes. Me, Bernie goes on to talk about things like infrastructure to which everybody agreed living wage to which everybody agreed.

“During a MSNBC town hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin — labeled “Trump Country” by host Chris Hayes — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) calmly walked a Trump voter through GOP plans to gut the social safety net after she insisted that no one listened to small town voters like herself.

Introduced earlier as Gail Sparks, who claims she skipped voting in 2012 but voted for Trump in 2016 because she wanted change, the woman first complained about undocumented immigrants — calling them “those people” — taking jobs where she worked, which she claimed depressed her own pay.

With several panelists disregarding Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric and wild claims, saying Congress would reel him in, Sparks brought up the social safety net and questioned who is paying for it in the long run.

“Who’s paying for this? Who’s paying for the Medicaid? Who’s paying for the Social Security? Who’s paying for the Medicare?” she asked rhetorically. “Now, have any of you seen down on the streets that it seems as though we have become the silent minority and not the majority?”

When Bernie Sanders announced a week or so ago that he was going to be doing a town hall on Fox News, a lot of Democrats towards the center of the political spectrum. We're angry. How dare he, how dare Bernie Sanders go on Fox News to talk to these people? The DNC is boycotting Fox News. We're not going to let them host a debate. So Bernie is breaking ranks once again, causing chaos, throwing the entire party into disarray. And so finally, yesterday Bernie Sanders came out and he said, listen, Fox News is 100% of propaganda arm for the White House. Totally get it, understand it, but they've got an audience of millions of people. And I want to go on there and tell those millions of people. One simple message and that message is that Trump lied to you. Trump lied to you. And then he went on to explain the things Trump lied about, for example, that he was going to protect healthcare in the United States. 

And in reality, he's trying to kick 20 to 40 million people off their health insurance by getting rid of Obamacare. He said he wasn't going to touch Medicare, medicaid or social security, but oh no. The budget actually includes cuts for those programs. He lied to you again. He has lied to you about everything and that is the message that Bernie Sanders wants to take onto Fox News. Now, for me personally, when I saw that he was going to do a town hall and Fox News, I wasn't angry. I didn't think he was breaking ranks. Each individual candidate can do a town hall with whatever network they want to, but as a party, I agree they should not, but I got to thinking at first again, it was okay, well you can do it, but what's the point? You're not going to change their minds. 

But after listening to him with his reasoning and his explanation, it actually does make a lot of sense because when you think about it this way, if there is a one on one, if you just have one person sitting there and explaining to you calmly and carefully and calculated how Donald Trump lied to you using specific examples and facts and figures and statistics, you can reach those people. The entire audience and Fox News is not gone. The hosts are, there is no reasoning with any of those people, but it's not always the case with those viewers. And I think sometimes we miss that. But that is something you can do in a one on one town hall that you could not do with a 14 or 10 or even five person debate because there's not enough time to elaborate. Everybody can spit out talking points, but you can't spit out policy and statistics and things like that in any kind of meaningful way.

“Fairly placid CNN town hall featuring Bernie Sanders grew heated when a Trump voter who identified himself as a businessman complained about the regulatory atmosphere under President Barack Obama — only to have the Vermont Senator lecture him on greed.

Host Chris Cuomo introduced the man, identified as Jim Jacobs from Pennsylvania, who immediately complained about Obama.

“My question is this. I’m a business owner and we keep getting kicked in the teeth by this administration,” Jacobs asserted. “It’s regulation after regulation and tax after tax. What Donald Trump does understand is the complexities of business and to reward the person who takes the risk. My question is: this country was founded on entrepreneurship. Why is this administration so against the business owner? Please tell me.”

Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers ratcheted up pressure on Walt Disney World on Monday by announcing legislation that will use the regulatory powers of Florida government to exert unprecedented oversight on the park resort's rides and monorail.  Lawmakers will introduce a bill in coming weeks that would end an exemption for Disney parks when it comes to ride inspections by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, DeSantis said at a news conference near Disney World.  The agriculture agency is responsible for inspecting amusement rides in Florida, but an exception was carved out for the state's largest theme park operators, such as Disney and Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences. Under the proposal, the exemption would end for rides located in special districts, which basically targets just Disney World.  An emailed inquiry seeking comment was sent to Disney on Monday.

Ron DeSantis plans to propose pay increases and more bonuses for every law enforcement officer, first responder and EMT in the next legislative session, he announced Monday during a news conference. 

He shared the budget proposal alongside Florida Highway Patrol officers and troopers in Orlando. The governor was adamant that the state of Florida supports members of law enforcement in a nation he said where some groups advocate to ""defund the police.""  

In an effort to continue his support for law enforcement in the state, DeSantis said he will be recommending $73 million in the next legislative session to increase the minimum pay for entry-level sworn state law enforcement officers by 20 percent. He is hopeful that this increase will help the state recruit more law enforcement officers.

In this Speech, he also quotes: ""I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify. Who doesn’t see red states or blue states — only the sees the United States.

In a passionate speech, Vivek highlights the need to hold the Biden Administration accountable for their actions, refusing to let political agendas overshadow the pursuit of justice.

Unyielding in his commitment to transparency and accountability, Vivek declares that if the Biden Administration fails to respond within 20 days, he will utilize his campaign funds to take legal action against them. This bold step emphasizes his determination to uphold the principles of fairness and integrity in our democratic system.

During the conference, Vivek reveals a powerful initiative he undertook by sending letters to every presidential campaign. In these letters, he pledges to pardon Donald Trump on day one of his presidency, showcasing his unwavering commitment to bridging political divides and allowing the people of this country to elect their leader without undue interference or bias.

With a resolute conviction in speaking truth and standing on principle, Vivek passionately defends the importance of due process and the presumption of innocence. He firmly believes that judgments should be reserved for the court of law, rather than being influenced by partisan narratives or political witch hunts.

As the press conference concludes, Vivek reminds us that this is a 1776 moment—a crucial time in history where we must safeguard the principles that made our nation great. He emphasizes the need for the American people to have the power to elect their next leader, ensuring that America is best positioned for a prosperous and secure future.

Don't miss this empowering press conference as Vivek fights for justice and calls for the people's voice to shape America's destiny. Together, we can forge a brighter future based on integrity, liberty, and the will of the American people.

By Paul LeBlanc, CNN

Beyond her text to Meadows about invoking martial law, Greene has drawn attention in recent days for the unprecedented hearings that focus on whether she should be disqualified from seeking reelection because of her role in the January 6 insurrection.

The tirade forced Chairman Mark Green, a Republican of Tennessee, to shut down her questioning and bar her from speaking for the rest of the hearing.""*

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career.

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

""Nearly 40% of people in the United States said they or a family member delayed medical care last year due to the prohibitively high cost of treatment under the nation's for-profit healthcare model, according to a Gallup survey published Tuesday.

As U.S. residents faced soaring prices for private insurance, the percentage of them forgoing medical services as a result of the costs climbed 12 points in one year, from 26% in 2021 to 38% in 2022. Of those who reported postponing treatment last year, 27% said they or a family member did so ""for a very or somewhat serious condition,"" up nine points from the previous year.

""After health insurance companies raised prices 24% last year and made nearly $12 billion in profits last quarter, 38% of Americans now report they or a family member put off needed medical care because it was too expensive,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted in response to the new findings. ""We must end this corporate greed. We need Medicare for All.""

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

""In a speech at Georgetown University on Thursday afternoon, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who's seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, did something unprecedented for a major candidate: He made the case for democratic socialism.

The address, which Sanders wrote himself, had been in the works for weeks, and in it Sanders embraced a label that has most often been used to attack him. (At the first Democratic presidential debate last month, front-runner Hillary Clinton distanced herself from Sanders' ""democratic socialist"" views.) At times, this address sounded much like Sanders' stump speech: He railed against Wall Street, the ""ruling class,"" and the billionaire Koch brothers. But he tied those stances to an ideology that he contended was an essential part of the United States' heritage.”*

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

“The daughter of Eric Garner, the man who died two years ago after New York City police placed him in a chokehold, walked out of an ABC News taping of a town hall with President Barack Obama Thursday in protest, saying network producers broke a promise to highlight her questions.

Erica Garner is now denouncing the session on race, saying she was “lied to” and was “railroaded” by ABC producers who ignored her questions for the president.

“ABC is using black lives as a rating and to get paid,” Garner told HuffPost in an exclusive video statement. “They guaranteed me that I would be asking the president direct questions about what’s going on. I was lied to.”

Joe Biden sits down with Dylan Mulvaney to discuss trans rights as part of NowThis' presidential forum. Dylan Mulvaney began documenting her gender transition on TikTok the day she came out to her friends and family. After more than 200 days posting about her experience to her now 8 million followers, she’s learned more about the ways in which her community has been targeted, and has become a committed advocate.

Watch the full presidential forum » https://youtu.be/m8tT6gNej8A

As part of NowThis' 'Make Your Mark' midterms coverage, we hosted an intimate conversation between President Joe Biden and young change-makers focused on finding solutions to some of the most critical issues facing their generation: gun legislation, abortion access, trans rights, economic instability, the climate crisis, and criminal legal reform.

A number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced and enacted on the state level in recent months, with many aimed at attacking transgender rights by outlawing gender affirming health care and prohibiting trans kids from playing in youth sports that align with their identity.

In 2018, 19 anti-trans bills were introduced in on the state level across the country, according to a Washington Post analysis of ACLU data. Now, just 4 years later, state legislatures have already introduced 155 bills.

Since taking office, President Joe Biden has signed several executive orders to protect trans rights. These include orders that rolled back the Trump-era ban on transgender military service, combated workplace discrimination policies, and protected transgender youths’ healthcare.

Dylan Mulvaney has publicly been sharing her transition on TikTok with her viral “Days of Girlhood” series. She spoke with Biden at Now This’ Presidential Forum about the right-wing attacks on trans lives and how the administration can better advocate for the trans community.

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

Bernie ","Senator Bernie Sanders joins us at Penguin to answer some Big Questions on why billionaires are bad for society, has the media changed politics, has politics become less progressive, and whether the Supreme Court should be elected. Order your copy of 'IT'S OKAY TO BE ANGRY ABOUT CAPITALISM' here: http://bit.ly/3mmp9cf

It's OK to be angry about capitalism. It's OK to want something better. Bernie Sanders takes on the 1% and speaks blunt truths about a system that is fuelled by uncontrolled greed, and rigged against ordinary people. Where a handful of oligarchs have never had it so good, with more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes, and the vast majority struggle to survive. Where a decent standard of living for all seems like an impossible dream.

How can we accept an economic order that allows three billionaires to control more wealth than the bottom half of our society? How can we accept a political system that allows the super-rich to buy elections and politicians? How can we accept an energy system that rewards the fossil fuel corporations causing the climate crisis? How can we let it happen any longer? We must demand fundamental economic and political change. This is where the path forward begins.

It's OK To Be Angry About Capitalism presents a vision of what would be possible if the political revolution took place. If we would finally recognize that economic rights are human rights, and work to create a society that provides them. This isn't some utopian fantasy; this is democracy as we should know it. Is it really too much to ask?

""In an interview scheduled to air Sunday on 60 Minutes, America’s most widely covered new House member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) floats the idea of a top marginal income tax rate as high as 70 percent as part of a plan to finance a 'Green New Deal' that would aim to drastically curb America’s carbon dioxide emissions.

This is not a formal policy proposal. Indeed, the whole idea of offsetting the budgetary cost of decarbonization with taxes is somewhat at odds with the main currents of thought in the Green New Deal universe, which lean more toward the idea that deficits don’t matter and the costs shouldn’t be paid for at all.

Seventy percent is a lot higher than the current rate and will doubtless fuel the conservative effort to paint AOC as a know-nothing, but the number is in line with one prominent strain of recent economics research and is at least moderately well supported by America’s historical experience.""

Known to many as AOC, the progressive politician discussed the details of the Green New Deal - a massive resolution on the House floor that she co-sponsored to combat the environmental impacts of climate change.  Watch this extended interview as AOC breaks down why people should care about the Green New Deal, how it would create job security for marginalized communities as well as those who work for the fossil fuel industry, and how she and her political allies are already passing pieces of it in Congress.

AOC: Sometimes it feels like everyone's looking at you and no one is. But now everyone actually is looking at me and I'm like… oh my god.'

Rep. Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez on breaking the mold.

AOC: 'Being bright in a place that is not usually bright, wearing a red lip in a place where there aren't too many red lips. It's it's really thrilling even though it can kind of feel like you’re breaking a rule sometimes.

There were so few other people that I felt like looked like me or or had lived my path and doing what I was doing. I felt like I had to kind of carve out a way of doing this on my own that was authentically me. And so it's been scary and it's been exciting.'

The Bronx-born 29-year-old daughter of Puerto Rican parents is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.
 
AOC: 'And so when you're only seeing white dudes just like running the world. You think you need to act like a white dude to run the world. Like, straight up like you think you need to talk a certain way dress a certain way have your shoulder pads out to here, be like ‘Hi, Jan!’

There's even just a few ways to wear professional clothing in an environment like that where even you just showing up to work wearing what you wear is breaking a mold of some kind.'

Ocasio-Cortez has been scrutinized for her clothing but she’s also used her style to make a statement.

AOC: 'The problem is, that that mold wasn't made for you. And so even if you try the hardest at being not you will not be as good as someone who's just that already.  I want to show other people that there are other ways of being powerful in the world.  

When you decide that you want to be just brave it it opens up way more possibilities than trying to be perfect ever does...

When you do something in a different way, it forces other people to adapt and change and it lets you kind of break away and set the tone for things instead of trying to follow the path that's already well-worn.

You work and then you get to a place where your colleagues are people that that aren't like you a lot of the time. And so I think what I always focus on is holding the door open for all of the other people like you that are to come.

Work is not just how much value you're creating to the exterior world. Sometimes work is how much value you're creating to yourself. '

In the video, Trump reads from a teleprompter, “but this election is now over. Congress has certified the results” before stopping and saying he did not want to say “the election’s over.”

“I don't want to say the election's over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results without saying the election's over,” Trump said in the video.

The hearing focused on what President Donald Trump was doing during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol in an effort to interrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory.

In the year since its creation, the committee has conducted more than 1,000 interviews, seeking critical information and documents from people witness to, or involved in, the violence that day.

Hillsdale College is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women “grateful to God for the inestimable blessings” resulting from civil and religious liberty and “believing that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It pursues the stated object of the founders: “to furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education” outstanding among American colleges “and to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.” As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains “by precept and example” the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.",0:26:14,Woke Capitalism Against America | Vivek Ramaswamy,"Speech delivered on April 28, 2021.

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

For further details: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-student-debt-plan-wants-would-erase-college-loans-by-taxing-wall-street/

The proposal is the latest from a Democratic presidential candidate that aims to tackle the growing problem of student debt, which has been blamed for blunting the economic prospects of million of Americans. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sanders' rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, in April issued a plan to forgive student debt for college grads by adding an annual 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million and a 1 percent tax on wealth more than $1 billion.

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

Bernie Sanders knows what energizes his crowds: Big ideas. Visions of political revolution. New ways of doing things. It’s why his supporters love him. But it’s also why many Democrats are still unsure about him.

But as Vox’s Matthew Yglesias argues, a good answer to that uncertainty can be found in Bernie Sanders’s political record; both as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and as Vermont’s representative to the US House and Senate. Sanders is a lifelong politician. And if you look at what he’s done, there’s a lot to learn about what he would do if he actually became president.   

So: What does Sanders’s record actually tell us? What kind of president would he be? And what would his advantage be in a general election against Donald Trump?

★ About Bernie:
Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. He is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders previously served as mayor of Vermont’s largest city for eight years before defeating an incumbent Republican to be the sole congressperson for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane and has four children and seven grandchildren.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq.

In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

Following Donald Trump's horrendous town hall on cnn Wednesday evening, Marjorie Taylor Green took to Twitter to announce that not only had she talked on the phone to Donald Trump, she posted a picture of her on the phone. There's no video, but we're, you know, you gotta take her word for it, that that photo of her on the phone smiling real big is her talking to Donald Trump. But here is the caption that she put along with that very disgusting little picture. She said, I enjoyed congratulating President Trump on his outstanding town hall, an undefeated record against cnn. 

Okay, I'm gonna have to go ahead and just stop right there before I can even finish this. What does that even mean? Undefeated record against CNN Undefeated was, was c supposed to defeat him? Like were, were, did you, did you like, think this was gonna be a fight? I mean, c n invited him and then packed the audience, which this was revealed before it even started with sympathetic Trump voters like this. This was not a confrontation, even though Kaitlyn Collins for a while, attempted to fact check him mildly, um, beyond that, it was like the Trump show. So it wasn't a confrontation at all. So I don't know why you're saying he's undefeated when nobody was trying to defeat him on that program. Anyway, the idiot continues. They had to air him telling the truth about the 2020 election. We laughed and laughed. Trump did not tell the truth about the 2020 election. 

And that, of course, is one of the areas where Caitlin Collins repeatedly pushed back and told him that what he is saying is not true. But she just laughed and laughed. I mean, he's out there lying to the entire world. No, boy, is that not the funniest thing you've ever seen, this powerful alleged billionaire, uh, who was impeached twice while he is in office. She's currently under criminal indictment on dozens of counts. But, it's just so funny when he is lying to everybody, like, who, what a hoot, right? We just laughed and laughed. She says, I'm sorry, but I don't think platforming a serial liar is a laughing matter. I don't think Donald Trump repeatedly telling lie after lie, after lie is funny in any way. I think it's disgusting that that is, that is what this country has come to, that that is the leading candidate that Republicans have. A man who is almost at this point, psychologically incapable of telling the truth. I don't find anything funny about a possibly mentally ill individual that psychiatrists and psychologists and mental health professionals have been sounding the alarm about for years. I don't find it funny that he could end up back in the White House. That is not something that I call humor. 

But she had actually 

Sent out another tweet prior to that where she said this, I'm so proud of President Trump tonight. Great job. He is truly showing everyone why he is the President American needs. He is doing a town hall with cnn who has attacked him more than anyone. Biden won't even talk, can't even talk to the press. But President Trump loves this country and is showing he's willing to fight for it.

""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was caught on video laughing about how she has been abusing House rules to troll her colleagues and prevent Congress from getting work done, saying it’s “fun” to use a tactic she developed to slow down LGBTQ equality legislation on other bills.

Speaking at a Republican rally in Woodlands, Texas last week, Greene discussed her use of roll call votes to adjourn the House of Representatives in order to slow down work in the House. The move required all members of the House to come to the House floor and vote to keep on working for the rest of the day, a process that took over an hour each time she did it. Greene got support from her fellow Republicans who mostly voted in favor of going home early for the day.

It was the tactic she used to stop the Equality Act, a bill that would add gender identity and sexual orientation to existing federal civil rights legislation, banning anti-LGBTQ discrimination in employment, credit, housing, and other areas. But that’s not how she presented it at the rally.""

The Intercept presents a film narrated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and illustrated by Molly Crabapple.

Set a couple of decades from now, the film is a flat-out rejection of the idea that a dystopian future is a forgone conclusion. Instead, it offers a thought experiment: What if we decided not to drive off the climate cliff? What if we chose to radically change course and save both our habitat and ourselves?

We realized that the biggest obstacle to the kind of transformative change the Green New Deal envisions is overcoming the skepticism that humanity could ever pull off something at this scale and speed. That’s the message we’ve been hearing from the “serious” center for four months straight: that it’s too big, too ambitious, that our Twitter-addled brains are incapable of it, and that we are destined to just watch walruses fall to their deaths on Netflix until it’s too late.

This film flips the script. It’s about how, in the nick of time, a critical mass of humanity in the largest economy on earth came to believe that we were actually worth saving. Because, as Ocasio-Cortez says in the film, our future has not been written yet and “we can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

But because of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s polarizing Green New Deal, climate change could become a big issue in the 2020 presidential elections.

It’s dividing Democrats, and it’s become a punchline among conservatives.

Senate Republicans just forced a procedural vote on the long-shot Green New Deal resolution.

The measure failed.

The vast majority of Democrats voted “present” to avoid going on record on something that couldn’t pass in a GOP-controlled Senate. That would have left them open to attacks on the 2020 campaign trail.

But the Green New Deal has already affected the political landscape in a big way. Here’s how.

Ohio’s horse in the first Republican presidential primary debate struts with the confidence of a Preakness thoroughbred. Cincinnati native Vivek Ramaswamy is turning heads as a slick, self-assured newcomer with all the charm and charisma of Harold Hill, the fast-talking traveling salesman in The Music Man.

Hill is a poser trying to con the naïve townsfolk of River City, Iowa. Ramaswamy is another fast-talking character traveling the small town circuit, flashing smiles, selling subjective “truth,” and gladhanding the good people of Iowa to place second or third in the state’s GOP caucuses.

Ramaswamy’s performance on the stump is as impressive as “Professor” Hill’s but hardly benign. Scratch the surface of the huckster sporting a hat with “Truth” emblazoned across the front and you’ve got trouble with a capital T. Behind the glib 38-year-old’s telegenic veneer and articulate spiel is a distinctly authoritarian mindset.

Stephen Colbert took over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

But before she became a political rockstar, AOC was a grassroots activist who worked as a waitress and bartender.

""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told TMZ on Thursday that she would have no issue with a president of the United States who recreationally smokes marijuana, arguing that 'there’s really no difference' between THC and alcohol.

'We need to accept that there is nothing more inherently damaging about marijuana than say legal substances, like alcohol or anything else,' she told the outlet, while walking through the Capitol. 'So, I’m glad that we’re moving towards a more just position as a party and that we’re moving to legalize marijuana but not just legalize marijuana but to really make up for the damages done by the war on drugs and the people who were unjustly incarcerated by the war on drugs.'

When asked by the reporter if she would 'be OK to have a president who say that they do smoke,' the Democratic socialist lawmaker said, 'Yeah, I don’t care.'""

""Go big or go home.

That, essentially, is the position of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as it relates to acting on climate change. And anyone who feels differently should be prepared to face her wrath. And that includes the current leader of the 2020 Democratic field.

At a Green New Deal rally in Washington on Monday night, the freshman House member took a shot at former Vice President Joe Biden — who is reportedly seeking a “middle ground” approach on climate change.

“I will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act are going to try to come back today and say we need a middle of the road approach to save our lives!” Ocasio-Cortez said. “That is too much for me.”

""Thousands of migrant children who crossed the southern border into the U.S. have reported they were sexually assaulted while in government custody, according to Department of Health and Human Services documents released Tuesday by Rep. Ted Deutch's office.

In the past four years, 4,556 children said they were sexually assaulted while in the care of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes custody of unaccompanied minors who cross the southern border alone and those who are separated from their families. 

Allegations go back to 2015, meaning the reported assaults started under the Obama administration. But the allegations have increased in the past two years after the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policy that led to at least 2,800 family separations flooding the department with additional children.""

Ohio Senator J. D. Vance addressed the Senate committee this morning. 

Nearly five weeks since the toxic Ohio train derailment happened in East Palestine, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw is in Washington to testify during a Senate Committee hearing.

Prior to the start of Thursday's hearing, Norfolk Southern released Shaw's full prepared remarks, which you can read below. The rail company says Shaw will provide details on Norfolk Southern's commitment to making it right in East Palestine, progress on environmental remediation and the company's focus on safety.

Chairman Carper, Ranking Member Capito, and distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear today to discuss the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. My name is Alan Shaw, and I have been the President and CEO of Norfolk Southern since May 2022. I look forward today to sharing our progress cleaning the derailment site, assisting families whose lives were disrupted, investing in the community, and making Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry safer. I am deeply sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the people of East Palestine and surrounding communities, and I am determined to make it right.
